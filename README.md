# Description

Prac is an anti-cheat created by Program, the goal is to detect cheaters and check if players are using some clients.
You can add a configuration to disable Prac on some players, like on Moderators or you (if you're flying for example).

# Configuration

If a player in your game is a moderator, you have values to disable the verifications on the players you want.

- `config.lua` configuration for a player
- `globalConfig.lua` configuration for the project

# Detection

- Speedhack (WIP)
- HealthHack (WIP)
- Fly (WIP)
- Wallhack (WIP)

# Installation

Place scripts in the ServerScriptService location, it's a safe place for admin scripts!
